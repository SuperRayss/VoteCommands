# VoteCommands
Democracy is important.

When someone starts a vote, you have 30 seconds to vote "yay" on it. To vote, type "y" in chat.
There are two different types of votes, one to restart the run, and another to kick a specified player.

*Start a vote to kick a player: votekick / vote_kick [name / number]*

*Start a vote to restart the run: voterestart / vote_restart*

Disclaimer: Some documentation refers to a command that exist from another mod I've created which isn't public yet. I'll be making that one public in a bit.
